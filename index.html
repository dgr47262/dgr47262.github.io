		<h3>History</h3>
		<p class="b">
		Like mentioned before, the island of Hawaii was made a state in the year 1959. However the history of this
		island stretches much farther than the 60 years since it became a state. The island was first inhabited by
		humans around 1000 A.D and they lived in isolation for hundreds of year until discovered by British explorer
		James Cook in 1778. Hawaii was then made a territory by 1898 and finally made a state by 1959.
