		<h3><big>History</big></h3>
		<p class="b">
		Like mentioned before, the island of Hawaii was made a state in the year 1959. However the history of this
		island stretches much farther than the 60 years since it became a state. The island was first inhabited by
		humans around 1000 A.D and they lived in isolation for hundreds of year until discovered by British explorer
		James Cook in 1778. Hawaii was then made a territory by 1898 and finally made a state by 1959.

		The island of Oahu is the most popular island of Hawaii due to it being the home of the state capital(Honolulu),
		as well as the site of Pearl harbor which many visit to pay respect to the many victims of that attack. Maui provides
		some of the most beautiful sites in the whole state with huge waterfalls and deep, green valleys that make it look like
		an island paradise. Kauai is known as the "garden island" for its dense tropical forests and white sandy beaches.
		All of the islands, though similar to one another, provide their own incredible experience.
